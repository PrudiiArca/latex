In this repository the following items will be saved:

- preset.tex: A preset file for writing LaTeX. It contains 
  . all required packages
  . a special kind of theorem types (independent from amsthm)
  . ligatures for math mode
  . diagram environments (for category theory and graph theory)
  . useful (and sometimes changed) mathmode commands
  This file might be split into separate files later on...
